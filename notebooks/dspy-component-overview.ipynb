    "## Signatures\n",
    "In DSPy, a **signature** is more or less a blueprint to define what you expect to feed as an **input** versus what you expect to get back as an **output**. Given that our goal may be to optimize our prompt template, our signature does NOT need to contain a robust prompt template that you may be used to forming through trial-and-error experiments. We might provide details to the signature where things may be ambiguous, but by and large, we do not need a fully fledged prompt template to get started.\n",

    "- Setting the **data type** of the inputs / outputs\n",
    "- Providing a **brief description** of what the input / output is\n",

    "\n",
    "DSPy offers two ways to create signatures: a **simpler string-based inline signature** and a **more robust class-based signature**. The simpler version is intended to offer a simple means to get going quickly; however, I personally am concerned with the lack of \"rigidity\" that the inline approach offers. Specifically, if you're using an IDE like VS Code, it won't be able to catch syntax errors in the inline version of the signature. Additionally, if you have a complex set of inputs and outputs, that can quickly get messy in the inline approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I will demonstrate both approaches in this notebook, but in the other tutorials, you will see that I will be using the class-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: In order to make this sample code work, we're going to have to make use of a simple **DSPy module** called `dspy.Predict()`. At this point in the tutorial, we have not yet covered modules, so please skip on down to that section if you want a better intuition on the code here.)"
