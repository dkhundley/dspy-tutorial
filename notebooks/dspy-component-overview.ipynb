    "## Signatures\n",
    "In DSPy, a **signature** is more or less a blueprint to define what you expect to feed as an **input** versus what you expect to get back as an **output**. Given that our goal may be to optimize our prompt template, our signature does NOT need to contain a robust prompt template that you may be used to forming through trial-and-error experiments. We might provide details to the signature where things may be ambiguous, but by and large, we do not need a fully fledged prompt template to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't provide a full prompt template, we may need to supply the signature with a few details to help the model understand what we are specifically expecting. This may include...\n",

    "- Setting the **data type** of the inputs / outputs\n",
    "- Providing a **brief description** of what the input / output is\n",
    "- Providing an expected **input / output structure** of what the inputs / outputs will consist of\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy offers two ways to create signatures: a **simpler string-based inline signature** and a **more robust class-based signature**. The simpler version is intended to offer a simple means to get going quickly; however, I personally am concerned with the lack of \"rigidity\" that the inline approach offers. Specifically, if you're using an IDE like VS Code, it won't be able to catch syntax errors in the inline version of the signature. Additionally, if you have a complex set of inputs and outputs, that can quickly get messy in the inline approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I will demonstrate both approaches in this notebook, but in the other tutorials, you will see that I will be using the class-based approach."
