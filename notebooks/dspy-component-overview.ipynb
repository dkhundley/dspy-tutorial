    "## Signatures\n",
    "In DSPy, a **signature** is more or less a blueprint to define what you expect to feed as an **input** versus what you expect to get back as an **output**. Given that our goal may be to optimize our prompt template, our signature does NOT need to contain a robust prompt template that you may be used to forming through trial-and-error experiments. We might provide details to the signature where things may be ambiguous, but by and large, we do not need a fully fledged prompt template to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't provide a full prompt template, we may need to supply the signature with a few details to help the model understand what we are specifically expecting. This may include...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting the **data type** of the inputs / outputs\n",
    "- Providing a **brief description** of what the input / output is\n",
    "- Providing an expected **input / output structure** of what the inputs / outputs will consist of\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy offers two ways to create signatures: a **simpler string-based inline signature** and a **more robust class-based signature**. The simpler version is intended to offer a simple means to get going quickly; however, I personally am concerned with the lack of \"rigidity\" that the inline approach offers. Specifically, if you're using an IDE like VS Code, it won't be able to catch syntax errors in the inline version of the signature. Additionally, if you have a complex set of inputs and outputs, that can quickly get messy in the inline approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I will demonstrate both approaches in this notebook, but in the other tutorials, you will see that I will be using the class-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: In order to make this sample code work, we're going to have to make use of a simple **DSPy module** called `dspy.Predict()`. At this point in the tutorial, we have not yet covered modules, so please skip on down to that section if you want a better intuition on the code here.)"

    "\n",
    "Notice something additional here that is not possible in the inline-based method: we can provide a docstring at the top of the class-based signature. This helps to guide our later DSPy module to form something like a goal to achieve when performing the prompt template optimization. You shouldn't look at this docstring as something you need to get perfect, as you might in something like trail-and-error prompt engineering testing. Instead, think of it as a high-level guide to help the model understand what you're trying to achieve.\n",
